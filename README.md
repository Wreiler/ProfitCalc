# ProfitCalc
Calculation of an employee's monthly wage
##### I used tkinter, yalm and PIL libraries


Desktop interface application on Python to calculate all the nuances of my father's profit
--------------------------------------------------------------



- The calculation is carried out on two machines - AC1 and AC2

  For each day and night shifts are recorded
  
  In the day shifts, the percentage of completion of the required number of boxes (planned and completed) is set and calculated
  
- Next step - the values of the advance and rates per hour for both machines

  Rate values are constants and are stored in a yalm file, but they can be changed inside the application

- The results are calculated salaries for each car with optionally variable bonus values

  As well as consolidated totals, including the final salary including taxes
_________________________________

----- The application has functional buttons for returning to the previous step, as well as again to the next one with saving the values

----- Also, the application takes into account possible input errors or empty fields!

----- The app has a menu.

      Data entry pages have functions:
      - New calculation
      - Open... (open a ready-made calculation with values in a json file)
      - Save
      - Save as...
      - Exit

      On the results page:
      - New calculation
      - Save calculation results (as a screenshot of the final window)
      - Exit



#### Example of work:

1) Manual data entry
2) Opening the finished calculation
3) Saved calculation results as a screenshot
